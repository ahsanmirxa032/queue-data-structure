# queue-data-structure
This repository contains the implementation of the queue data structure in C++. The implementation includes both the linear queue and circular queue.

The linear queue implementation is done using an array, and the circular queue implementation uses a circular array. Both implementations support basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isFull/isEmpty checks.

The code is well-documented and organized in separate header and source files for easy understanding and modification. The repository also includes a sample program that demonstrates the usage of the implemented queue data structure.

Feel free to use this implementation in your projects or as a reference for learning queue data structure in C++. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.

Enjoy coding!
